5</span>ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.</h2>
<p>There lies a wold in Vester Haf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There builds a boor his hold;<br />
And thither he carries hawk and hound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll stay through winter&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>He takes with him both hound and cock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He means there long to stay;<br />
The wild deer in the wood that are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his arrival pay.</p>
<p>He hews the oak and poplar tall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He fells the good beech tree;<br />
Then fill&rsquo;d was the laidly Trold with spite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he should make so free.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>He hews him posts, he hews him balks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He early toils and late;<br />
Out spake the Trolds within the hill:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who knocks at such a rate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and spake the youngest Trold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As emmet small to view:<br />
&ldquo;O here is come a Christian man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But verily he shall rue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upstood the smallest of the Trolds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round he roll&rsquo;d his eyes:<br />
&ldquo;O we will hie to the yeoman&rsquo;s house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And o&rsquo;er him hold assize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hews away our sheltering wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile shall we be tame?<br />
No! I from him his wife will take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make him suffer shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Trolds in the hill that were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild for the fray upbound;<br />
They hie away to the yeoman&rsquo;s house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their tails all curling round.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Seven and a hundred were the Trolds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their laidliness was great;<br />
To the yeoman&rsquo;s house they&rsquo;ll go as guests,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With him to drink and eat.</p>
<p>The hound is yelling in the yard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The herdsman blows his horn;<br />
Crows the cock and clucks the hen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the yeoman throws them corn.</p>
<p>Of Villenskov the yeoman saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trolds the window through:<br />
&ldquo;Now help me Jesu, Mary&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those trolds have me in view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sign&rsquo;d the cross in every nook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But mostly in his room;<br />
Some of the Trolds in fright thereat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flew to the forest&rsquo;s gloom.</p>
<p>Some flew east, and some flew west,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some flew north away;<br />
And others flew to the valleys deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where still, I trow, they stay.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>But ah! the smallest of the Trolds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bold enter&rsquo;d at the door;<br />
For crossing he refus&rsquo;d to flee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was bent on mischief sore.</p>
<p>The housewife thought of a good device,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She plac&rsquo;d him at the board,<br />
And before him set both ale and meat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a courteous word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, husbandman of Villenskov,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attend to what I say;<br />
Who has to thee permission given<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To build where I have sway?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since thou to build within my bounds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast ta&rsquo;en the liberty,<br />
Thou shalt to me thy housewife give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For I with her will lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answer made the hapless man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As God gave him the thought:<br />
&ldquo;Thou shalt not Ellen get from me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like her I value nought.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>He answer made unto the Trold:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let but my wife alone,<br />
And do thou take my money and goods,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep them for thy own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will Ellen take, and thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tread ye both to gore;<br />
And I will take thy silver and gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hide it &rsquo;neath my floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yeoman and his household all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were seized with mighty fright:<br />
&ldquo;Better that one of us be lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than all destroy&rsquo;d outright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and stood the desp&rsquo;rate man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sore affliction rife;<br />
And he has given his Ellen dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the young Trold for wife.</p>
<p>Then wax&rsquo;d he glad, and sprang about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So fondly her he pressed;<br />
O then how pale her cheeks became,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She was so sore distrest!</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Then out and spake the afflicted Dame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst shedding many a tear:<br />
&ldquo;O God in mercy look on me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My fate is hard to bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did possess as fair a man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever walk&rsquo;d-on mead,<br />
But now perforce with laidly Trold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must do adulterous deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kiss&rsquo;d her once, he kiss&rsquo;d her twice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart yet sadder grew;<br />
The laidliest Devil he became<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That man did ever view.</p>
<p>When the third time he her would kiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She call&rsquo;d on Mary&rsquo;s son;<br />
Then he became a lovely knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His elfin shape was gone.</p>
<p>It happen&rsquo;d neath a linden green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was from woe releas&rsquo;d;<br />
Then straightway fled all fear and dread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So well they all were pleas&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;Hear, thou beloved Ellenlile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent my wife to be,<br />
And all the gold in England&rsquo;s isle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will bestow on thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was little, Death from me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother took away;<br />
My step-dame drove me forth, and I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Became a Trold so gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thy husband gifts of price<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And titles fair beside;<br />
In verity, thou yeoman&rsquo;s dame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt become my bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou noble knight, we&rsquo;ll thank the Lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From woe who set us free,<br />
If thou wilt wed some fair young maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You both may live in glee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thee I can&rsquo;t in marriage get<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have thy daughter bright,<br />
And all thy benefits to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By crowning her requite.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Thanks, Ellen, thanks, thou woman wise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To praise thee I&rsquo;ll not cease;<br />
If I may not thy love obtain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave thee here in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now builds the yeoman on his isle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no one him offends;<br />
His daughter bears old England&rsquo;s crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And happy days she spends.</p>
<p>Now Ellen has, the yeoman&rsquo;s wife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Escap&rsquo;d from care and harm;<br />
She&rsquo;s mother to a Queen, who sleeps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a Monarch&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Who bore him first a daughter fine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a blooming heir;<br />
They thank&rsquo;d the Lord on every side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all their fortune fair.</p>
<p>The daughter now of Ellenlile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of England has the sway;<br />
And Ellen with her yeoman lives,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each other&rsquo;s equals they.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From Heiberg</i>.</p>
<p>Thou who the strand dost wander,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy steps, O traveller, stay!<br />
Turn to the island yonder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And listen to my lay.<br />
Thy every meditation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid hither, hither stray:<br />
On yonder banks its station<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had once a Castelaye.</p>
<p>In long past days in glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It stood, and grandeur sheen<br />
Now &rsquo;twas so transitory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its ruins scarce are seen.<br />
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>But in old days I warrant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its equal was not found;<br />
From every side apparent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High tower&rsquo;d it from the ground.</p>
<p>For no sea-king intended<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I ween was yonder hold;<br />
Urania, it ascended<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In praise of thee so bold.<br />
Close by the ocean roaring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far, far from mortal jars,<br />
It stood tow&rsquo;rds heaven soaring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tow&rsquo;rds the little stars.</p>
<p>A gate in the wall eastward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Display&rsquo;d its mighty mouth;<br />
There was another westward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spires stood north and south.<br />
The dome itself, high rearing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A slender spirelet bore,<br />
Upon it, ever veering,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A Pegasus gilt o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Towers which the sight astounded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In north and south were plac&rsquo;d;<br />
Upon strong pillars founded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with fair galleries grac&rsquo;d.<br />
And there caught the attention<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those that thither stroll&rsquo;d,<br />
Quadrants of hugh dimension,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And speres in frames that roll&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>From yonder Castle, gazing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the isle, you spied<br />
The woods, their heads up-raising,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ocean&rsquo;s bluey tide.<br />
The halls the sight enchanted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With colours bright of blee;<br />
The gardens they were planted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a flower and tree.</p>
<p>When down came night careering<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And vanish&rsquo;d was the sun,<br />
The stars were seen appearing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All heaven&rsquo;s arch upon.<br />
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Then far was heard the yelling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When you thereto gave heed,<br />
Of those that watch&rsquo;d the dwelling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Four hounds of mastiff breed.</p>
<p>The good knight ceas&rsquo;d to walk on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fields of war and gore,<br />
His helm and sword the balk on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hung, to use no more.<br />
From earth, its woe and riot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His soul had taken flight,<br />
When in his chamber quiet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat at dead of night.</p>
<p>Then he his eye erected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the night so far,<br />
And keen the course inspected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of every twinkling star.<br />
The stars his fame transported<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wide over sea and land,<br />
And kings his friendship courted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sought his islet&rsquo;s strand.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>But point the stars from heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lands far o&rsquo;er the main;<br />
He went, by fortune driven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ne&rsquo;er returned again.<br />
The haughty walls through sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have long since sunken low,<br />
And heavy plow-shares furrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy house, Urania, now.</p>
<p>Each time the sun is sinking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It friendly looks on Hveen;<br />
Its rays there linger, thinking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On what the place has been.<br />
The moon hastes melancholy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Past, past the coast so dear,<br />
And in love&rsquo;s transport holy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shines Freya&rsquo;s starlet clear.</p>
<p>Then suddenly takes to heaving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that same ruin&rsquo;d hold<br />
The basis deep, believing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is some eve of old.<br />
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>For many moments gladly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould rise up from the mould;<br />
But ah! it can&rsquo;t, and sadly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinks in death&rsquo;s slumber cold.</p>

19</span>THE READY ANSWER.</h2>
<p>The brother to his dear sister spake;<br />
&ldquo;Wilt thou not quickly a husband take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear brother, I&rsquo;ll do no such thing,<br />
I&rsquo;m far too young for marrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why so oft do I hear it said<br />
That thou preparest thee to wed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! folks such store of scandal say,<br />
That only fools attention pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that gallant knight, that rode<br />
This morning early from thy abode?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very gallant knight, indeed,<br />
It was my page upon his steed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;What might that pair of shoes betide,<br />
That lately stood by thy bedside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If pair of shoes stood ever there,<br />
That pair of shoes my slippers were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those children small, how came they, say,<br />
The other day in thy bed that lay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No children small I ween were they,<br />
But pups with which I&rsquo;m wont to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How happ&rsquo;d this morn that baby scream.<br />
Which from thy chamber broke my dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O babes in that guise seldom squall,<br />
My maid cried for her keys so small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might that splendid cradle mean,<br />
Which hidden here I oft have seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was no cradle met thine eyes,<br />
But my silk woof about that lies.</p>

22</span>EPIGRAMS</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no living, my boy, without plenty of gold,<br />
But gold to obtain you must ever be bold.<br />
The Diver will never who feareth the shark<br />
Bring up precious pearls from the sea caverns dark.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>O think not you&rsquo;ll change what on high is designed,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though you lift up your hands and to heaven you
shout;<br />
The Angel will grieve not, who governs the wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though a gust should the lamp of the widow blow
out.</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p>Load not thyself with gold, O mortal man, for know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No strength thou&rsquo;lt have for loads when
summon&rsquo;d hence away.<br />
Avoid excess of meat, it maketh gross, I trow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gross thou must not be when summon&rsquo;d hence
away;<br />
For through the narrow gate thou&rsquo;lt find it hard to go<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of death, if thou art gross when summon&rsquo;d
hence away.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
